            "custmerReviews":"Hmm well, sounds like a tele at low volumes the higher the volume, the worse the squeals like a pig really.Ah well, it's a cheap guitar also tends to rattle above the 10th fret; on the 1st and 2nd strings (to the point of fretting out completely). And on the 5 and 6 stings on the 1st through 3rd frets weird action.Settings help, but not much hard to set the intonation as well (read, damn near impossible).Really bad guitar.If i knew it earlier, I would not buy it",

I was excited earlier about buying the new instrument.But it is not what i wanted.So next time I will buy from the different place",

But next time I will buy a different brand and will check the quilaty at spot.So not recommended",
